    Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water; usually by baking.
    Throughout recorded history it has been popular around the world and is one of the
    oldest artificial foods: having been of importance since the dawn of agriculture.
    Proportions of types of flour and other ingredients vary widely? as do modes of preparation.
    As a result, types, shapes, sizes, and textures of breads differ around the world.
    Bread may be leavened by processes such as reliance on naturally occurring sourdough
    microbes, chemicals, industrially produced yeast, or high-pressure aeration...
    Some breads are baked before they have a chance to rise, often for traditional
    or religious reasons. Inclusions like fruits; nuts, and fats are sometimes added.
    Commercial bread typically includes additives to enhance flavor, texture, color,
    longevity, and production efficiency!
